**Assuming everything's up to date, these are the currently supported sources for Submissions/Comments.**

*Since it is possible to have more than one of the same Source Type to track different areas of Reddit, 
and the unique name you give Sources can be embedded into the path files are saved under, 
there are plenty of options for manipulating input/output.*

+ Your Upvoted and/or Saved Posts & Comments
  + Scan all the posts you've personally Upvoted or Saved.
  + The original functionality of RMD, carried over.
  + For more flexible configuration, see the *User Upvoted/Saved* source.
  + For Comments, only comments you've Saved can be located.


+ User Upvoted/Saved Posts & Comments
  + Allows you to choose a Username, and scan their Upvoted and/or Saved posts
  + This Source only works for Users who are set to Public, or for your own account.
  + This Source has more functionality than the *Personal* Source
  + I suggest using this one on personal accounts instead, if you need advanced configuration.

  + As with many sources, supports sorting by "Hot/Top/Etc"
  + Also supports sorting by time. (Last Hour/Day/Month/All Time/Etc)
